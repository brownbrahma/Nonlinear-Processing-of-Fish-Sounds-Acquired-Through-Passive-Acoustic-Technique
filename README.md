# Nonlinear-Processing-of-Fish-Sounds-Acquired-Through-Passive-Acoustic-Technique
Many naturally occurring signals are found to be multifractal in nature (example, human heart beats), here we try to examine the multifractality of fish sounds. Terapon, Toad, Barred Grunt and Sciaenidae; This study was based on these fish species. Species based clustering was observed using features extracted through multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). The highest and the lowest degree of multifractality was observed in Sciaenidae and Terapon respectively. The type of multifractality was identified by using shuffling. Also the singularity spectrum obtained was analysed to obtain three important features namely, the spectrum width, the range and the asymmetry parameter (B).
